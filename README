This is a pipeline for simulating admixed genomes to evaluate the accuracy of local ancestry callers under different scenarios

Depends on:
fastahack - https://github.com/ekg/fastahack
seqtk - https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
wgsim - https://github.com/lh3/wgsim
perl Math::Random module - try cpan Math::Random to install

The first three programs need to be in your PATH

Takes two co-linear genome assemblies as input, simulates data according parameters and produces reads for input into AncestryHMM or otehr programs. See here for generating them if you don't have any available: https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PseudoreferencePipeline
