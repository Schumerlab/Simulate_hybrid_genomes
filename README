This is a pipeline for simulating admixed genomes to evaluate the accuracy of local ancestry callers under different scenarios

Depends on:
fastahack - https://github.com/ekg/fastahack
seqtk - https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
wgsim - https://github.com/lh3/wgsim
bedtools2 - https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2.git
perl Math::Random module - try cpan Math::Random to install

The first four programs need to be in your PATH. To test that they are type each program name and hit enter. If it returns usage they are installed properly. e.g.:

fastahack


Takes two co-linear genome assemblies as input, simulates data according parameters and produces reads for input into AncestryHMM or otehr programs. See here for generating them if you don't have any available: https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PseudoreferencePipeline

####EVALUATING ACCURACY
#######################

After your simulation, run Ancestry_HMM_pipeline as you would on any data (see: https://github.com/Schumerlab/Ancestry_HMM_pipeline)

Note that during the simulation an input reads file list is automatically generated. The name will be: 

simulated_hybrids_readlist_genX_prop_par1_Y

where X and Y are the parameters simulated.

Once the Ancestry_HMM_pipeline has finished you can run the following to determine accuracy:

perl post_hmm_accuracy_shell.pl ancestry-probs-par1_file ancestry-probs_par2_file path_to_simulation_reads_folder
