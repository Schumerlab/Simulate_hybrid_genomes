This is a pipeline for simulating admixed genomes to evaluate the accuracy of local ancestry callers under different scenarios

The following programs/dependencies **must** be in your PATH [better install coming soon]:

fastahack - https://github.com/ekg/fastahack
seqtk - https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
wgsim - https://github.com/lh3/wgsim
bedtools2 - https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2.git
SELAM - https://github.com/russcd/SELAM
macs & msformatter 

other dependencies:
perl Math::Random module - try cpan Math::Random to install
perl use Math::Round module - try cpan Math::Round to install
biopython

To test that programs are in your PATH type each program name and hit enter. If it returns usage they are installed properly. e.g.:

fastahack

Option 1: Simulates genome sequences with macs and simulates parental and hybrid haplotypes based on provided parameters. An ancestral sequence can also be used with this option.

Optuon 2: Takes two co-linear genome assemblies as input, simulates data according parameters and produces reads for input into AncestryHMM or otehr programs. See here for generating them if you don't have any available: https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PseudoreferencePipeline

####EVALUATING ACCURACY
#######################

After your simulation, run Ancestry_HMM_pipeline as you would on any data (see: https://github.com/Schumerlab/Ancestry_HMM_pipeline)

########
#INPUT FILES FOR HMM pipeline
#######

The input ancestry informative sites, parental counts, and parental genomes (only generated if macs is used) files will be automatically generated by the pipeline. Regardless of the simulation parameters, the counts and AIMs files will be called:

simulated_parental_counts_for_AncestryHMM
simulated_AIMs_for_AncestryHMM

If you specified use_map=1 the program will also output the following file with local recombination rates indicated:

simulated_parental_counts_for_AncestryHMM_recombination_prior.txt

During the simulation an input reads file list will also be automatically generated. The name will be: 

simulated_hybrids_readlist_genX_prop_par1_Y

where X and Y are the parameters simulated.

If you are using macs to simulate, the genomes will be:

macs_simulated_parent1.fa
macs_simulated_parent2.fa

###########

Once the Ancestry_HMM_pipeline has finished you can run the following to determine accuracy:

perl post_hmm_accuracy_shell.pl ancestry-probs-par1_file ancestry-probs_par2_file path_to_simulation_reads_folder path_to_simulator_install
